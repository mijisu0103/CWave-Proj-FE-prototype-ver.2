# CWave-Proj-FE-prototype-ver.2

This project includes codes I wrote and used to visualise the infrastructure our team built and further improvements on design.

This version was solely used for visualising prototype thus it is still minimal.

The project only lasted for three weeks and after our project ended, we lost our access to AWS. That is, we cannot present the working prototype anymore. 
For this reason, this version was created to present what would working prototype look like.

I am aware that it still needs improvements including adding a section where users can see their current region and select other regions for differentiated rankings and products.
